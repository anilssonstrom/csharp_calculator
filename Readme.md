Calculator app
==============

A simple calculator app to showcase some basic MAUI graphical programming in C#.
This example uses the MVVM pattern, via the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm NuGet package.

The starting point for the app is the project template ".NET MAUI App" for C# in Visual Studio 2022.

This program should work on Windows and Android. Untested on Mac and iPhone.

There are plenty of bugs to figure out and improvements to be made, but it was a quick stab.
